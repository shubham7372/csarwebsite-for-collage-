                            Campus radio (also known as college radio, university radio or student
                            radio) is a type of radio station that is run by the students of a
                            college, university or other educational institution. Programming may be
                            exclusively created or produced by students, or may include program
                            contributions from the local community in which the radio station is
                            based. Sometimes campus radio stations are operated for the purpose of
                            training professional radio personnel, sometimes with the aim of
                            broadcasting educational programming, while other radio stations exist
                            to provide alternative to commercial broadcasting or government
                            broadcasters.

                            Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some
                            combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm or otherwise expressive
                            content.Exact definitions of music vary considerably around
                            the world, though it is an aspect of all human societies, a cultural
                            universal. While scholars agree that music is defined by a few
                            specific elements, there is no consensus on their precise
                            definitions.The creation of music is commonly divided into musical
                            composition, musical improvisation, and musical performance, though
                            the topic itself extends into academic disciplines, criticism,
                            philosophy, and psychology. Music may be performed or improvised using a
                            vast range of instruments, including the human voice.
                          </p>

                            In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some
                            extent improvised. For instance, in Hindustani classical music, the
                            performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined
                            structure and using characteristic motifs. In modal jazz the performers
                            may take turns leading and responding, while sharing a changing set of
                            notes. In a free jazz context, there may be no structure whatsoever,
                            with each performer acting at their discretion. Music may be
                            deliberately composed to be unperformable, or agglomerated
                            electronically from many performances. Music is played in public and
                            private areas, highlighted at events such as festivals, rock concerts,
                            and orchestra performance, and heard incidentally as part of a score or
                            soundtrack to a film, TV show, opera, or video game. Musical playback is
                            the primary function of an MP3 player or CD player and a universal
                            feature of radios and smartphones.

                            Music often plays a key role in social activities, religious rituals,
                            rite of passage ceremonies, celebrations, and cultural activities. The
                            music industry includes songwriters, performers, sound engineers,
                            producers, tour organizers, distributors of instruments, accessories,
                            and sheet music. Compositions, performances, and recordings are assessed
                            and evaluated by music critics, music journalists, and music scholars,
                            as well as amateurs

                            200 countries. A rectangular field with a goal at each end is used to
                            play the game. The purpose of the game is to get the football into the
                            opposition goal using any part of the body other than the arms and
                            hands.

                            Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport in which two teams of 11 players compete
                            on a field with a rectangular 22-yard pitch in the middle. Batting
                            alternates between the two contending sides in an attempt to score runs.
                            The opposite team fields while one team bats. An innings is the unit of
                            measurement for each turn. Tests, One-Day Internationals, and Twenty-20
                            Internationals are the three different formats of cricket. The
                            popularity of cricket has risen dramatically since the introduction of
                            the T20 format. In India, Pakistan, Australia, England, South Africa,
                            Sri Lanka, New Zealand, the West Indies, Bangladesh, and Zimbabwe,
                            cricket is extremely popular. Because cricket is a popular sport in only
                            roughly 15 nations, the number of professional leagues in the world is
                            also limited. Cricket's league structure is very young, but it is
                            gaining popularity. The Indian Premier League, or IPL, is one of the
                            most prestigious sports leagues in the world, having only been
                            established a few years ago. Another significant competition of cricket
                            is the Big Bash League in Australia. More countries are gradually
                            constructing cricket leagues, and the number of professional leagues is
                            expected to rise in the near future.

                            18 inches (46 cm) and a height of 10 feet (3.0 m) mounted on a backboard
                            at each end. During ordinary play, a team can score a field goal by
                            shooting the ball through the basket. If a player is touching or closer
                            to the hoop than the three-point line on a field goal, the shooting team
                            receives two points, and three points if the player is below the
                            three-point line. At the end of the game, the team with the most points
                            wins. Basketball is the world's third most popular sport, both in terms
                            of participation and viewership. Basketball lovers number between 2 to 3

                            <p>
                              The National Service Scheme (NSS) is an Indian government-sponsored
                              public service program conducted by the Department of Youth Affairs
                              and Sports of the Government of India. Popularly known as NSS, the
                              scheme was launched in Gandhiji’s Centenary year, 1969. Aimed at
                              developing student’s personality through community service, NSS is a
                              voluntary association of young people in Colleges, Universities and at
                              +2 level working for a campus-community linkage. The cardinal
                              principle of the NSS programme is that it is organized by the students
                              themselves, and both students and teachers through their combined
                              participation in community service, get a sense of involvement in the
                              tasks of nation building.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              The Motto of NSS “Not Me But You”, reflects the essence of democratic
                              living and upholds the need for self-less service. NSS helps the
                              students develop appreciation to other person’s point of view and also
                              show consideration to ‘/other living beings. The philosophy of the NSS
                              is well doctrined in this motto, which underlines/on the belief that
                              the welfare .of an individual is ultimately dependent on the welfare
                              of the society on the whole and therefore, the NSS volunteers shall
                              strive for the well-being of the society.
